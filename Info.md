Designed to enable vertical and horizontal scaling of decentralized applications
The software provides accounts, authentication, databases, asynchronous communication, and the scheduling of applications across multiple CPU cores and/or clusters. The resulting technology is a blockchain architecture that has the potential to scale to millions of transactions per second, eliminates user fees, and allows for quick and easy deployment of decentralized applications.
C++ as its smart contract programming language
Underlying EOSIO is a WebAssembly (WASM) virtual machine which executes smart contract code
consensus mechanism of Delegated Proof of Stake
EOSIO is designed to have low latency
EOSIO based blockchains are upgradeable. This means developers can deploy code fix, add features, and/or change application logic, as long as sufficient authority is provide
Governance and resource allocation are programmed via smart contracts
